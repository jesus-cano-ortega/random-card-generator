[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://tan-wildebeest-sjz9lphu.ws-eu18.gitpod.io/)

The objective of this project is to display a random card from a deck of poker on the screen using a sequence of JavaScript functions that modifies the DOM.
To add a little more difficulty, we have decided that each of the buttons will offer to the user a certain type of card, one a simply random car, the other option showing
a card without repeating the suit, and the last one showing a unique card without repeating until the deck is over.

### Exercises 

Given an index.html document, the app.js file must modify the DOM in order to:

1. Create a function that show a random card (the suit and the number can be repeated)
2. Create a function that show a random card without repeating the previous suit
3. Create a function that show a unique random card without repeating

##### REMEMBER: 

Once the progress and flow of the project is finished, you must commit and push the repository remotely, using the following command:

```
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Message"
$ git push origin repo-remote
```
